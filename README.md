# [ADD YOUR USER NAME HERE] Project

This is a very basic starting point for your projects.

As you find useful information, remember to add it to the [class-notes](https://github.com/USU-ITLS-x265-23-summer/class-repo).

## Extensions

I strongly recommend installing the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.

VS Code and, by extension, the CodeSpace editor, come with built-in extensions.  One of these extensions has a snippets library that you should appreciate.  To see what I'm talking about, double-click to the `index.html` to the left of this editing and previewing area.  When `index.html` is the active editing file, type the letters `ht`, wait until you see a list apear, than select `html:5`.

## Git

The CodeSpace instance allows you to work completely independently on your code, but you still have to follow all the git steps to actually add the code to your project repo on GitHub.  If you look to the far left, you'll see a button that has 3 small circles & 2 lines.  If you've edited any files, you'll also see a blue dot with the count of edited files.  

Once there, read the ["Staging and committing code changes"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git#_staging-and-committing-code-changes) section and down.  

Do NOT follow anything before/above the "Staging and committing code changes" section â€” all of this is already configured when you created your CodeSpace from within the GitHub repo!
